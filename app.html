	Sync X presents you the "Sync Meet", an app which can fulfill these children's dreams of getting the education between this<br>
	 world wide lockdow. Our app is secure, free and compatible to every device. All you have to do is contact your school to <br>
	 us @sync-x.com for a glimpse how it works for a large organisation. Our UX/UI developer and Joint Secretary planned <br>
	 the app's blue print with a bunch of developers just ot make sure it doesn't have a huge bandwidth as compared to zoom and<br>
	  other apps. As some governments stated these apps as unsafe and can be easily accessible to hackers, for tackling such <br>
	  problems our app is being verified, getting more authentication and encryption with codes and pattern which are difficult <br>
	  to decode by any hacker so it is 100% safe.<br><br>
